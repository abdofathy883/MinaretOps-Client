## Screens and Routes

- Public
  - `/login`

- Authenticated
  - `/dashboard` ‚Äî embedded analytics dashboard
  - `/users`, `/users/add`, `/users/:id`, `/users/my-account/:id` ‚Äî user ops
  - `/services`, `/services/add`, `/services/:id`
  - `/clients`, `/clients/add`, `/clients/:id` ‚Äî includes task groups and task modals
  - `/tasks`, `/tasks/:id`
  - `/internal-tasks`, `/internal-tasks/add`, `/internal-tasks/:id`
  - `/attendance` (Admin)
  - `/announcements`, `/announcements/add`
  - `/leave-requests` (Admin)
  - `/complaints`, `/complaints/add` (Admin for listing)
  - `/contact-form-entries`, `/contact-form-entries/:id`
  - `/kpis-management` (Admin)
  - `/access-denied`, `/**` (not found)

Guards: `noauthGuard` protects private routes, `authGuard` prevents logged-in users from seeing `/login`, `roleGuard` enforces roles (e.g., Admin, AccountManager).

## Architecture

- Angular 19 Standalone App
  - Bootstrap via `bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)`
  - Routing and providers configured in `app.config.ts` and `app.routes.ts`
  - Service Worker registered with `registerWhenStable:30000` to minimize initial load impact

- Service Layer
  - `ApiService` wraps `HttpClient` with environment-based base URL
  - Domain services per feature area (`auth`, `clients`, `tasks`, `announcements`, `power-bi`, etc.)
  - Clear endpoints; adjust base URL in `src/environments/*.ts`

- Auth and State
  - `AuthService` manages JWT, refresh token storage, current user state via `BehaviorSubject`
  - Token validity checks (exp) and error handling with `HttpErrorResponse` mapping
  - `roleGuard` fetches user by id to evaluate roles (supports `requireAll`)

- PWA and Push
  - `ngsw-config.json` configures asset caching (app shell and lazy assets)
  - Custom `src/service-worker.js` extends Angular SW and handles push display/click
  - `PushNotificationService` uses `SwPush` to request subscriptions (set your VAPID key and backend endpoint)

- UI/UX
  - Bootstrap 5 + Bootstrap Icons
  - RTL HTML and Noto Sans Arabic
  - Modular pages with standalone components and shared UI (`shared/header`)

---

## Technology and Packages

- Angular Core: `@angular/*` 19.x
- HTTP: `HttpClient`
- Routing: `@angular/router`
- PWA: `@angular/service-worker`, custom `service-worker.js`
- State/Async: `rxjs`
- UI: `bootstrap@5.3`, `bootstrap-icons`
- Analytics: `powerbi-client`
- Uploads: `dropzone` (ready for file uploads, optional integration)

---

## Environments

- `src/environments/environment.ts`
  - `apiBaseUrl: 'https://localhost:5001/api'`
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
  - `apiBaseUrl: 'https://internal-api.theminaretagency.com/api'`

Switching occurs automatically via Angular‚Äôs build configurations.

---

## Security and Access

- JWT stored in `localStorage` with exp validation
- `noauthGuard` and `authGuard` gate routes and redirect appropriately
- `roleGuard` enforces route `data.roles`:
  - Example:
    ```ts
    {
      path: 'users/add',
      component: AddUserComponent,
      canActivate: [noauthGuard, roleGuard],
      data: { roles: ['Admin', 'AccountManager'] }
    }
    ```
